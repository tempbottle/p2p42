I'm borrowing some code from the boost tutorials and modifying it to suit my needs. Since the network system is the most important part of the game I'm developing, I will be doing most of my work on this repository.

42 is in the name because it is the minimum number of connections required to set up a 3-dimensional p2p network if each object is required to have 6 nearby connections close to each axis if the coordinate system is centered and rotated with the object.

This is basically the boost.asio chat client and chat server example mashed together, and I might submit it back to boost once I'm done modifying it. So:
